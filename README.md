This working is part of Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems discipline in Unisinos's Computer Science postgraduate program. Here you can find two solvers aproaches, firstly a implementation of [Breadth-first Search] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search). Second is used a implementation based on [A* Search Algorithm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).
 A simple python console application that reads an input sudoku from [_input.txt_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zanattabruno/sudoku-ia-unisinos/master/input.txt?token=AHTNX33H5GWYRPVB3WNKDUS7BPLS4) and solves it using above algorithms.
