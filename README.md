This working is part of Programming Techniques discipline in Unisinos's Computer Science postgraduate program. Here you can find two sudoku solvers aproaches, firstly a implementation of [Breadth-first Search] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search). Second is used a implementation based on [A* Search Algorithm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).
 A simple python console application that reads an input sudoku from [input.txt](input.txt) and solves it using above algorithms.

 # User Instructions
 ## Basic Utilization
 ### Input Board to Solve

 First insert the board to solve in the file [input.txt](input.txt) in format like this:

5 3 _ | _ 7 _ | _ _ _ /s
6 _ _ | 1 9 5 | _ _ _ /s
_ 9 8 | _ _ _ | _ 6 _ /s
------+-------+------ /s
8 _ _ | _ 6 _ | _ _ 3 /s
4 _ _ | 8 _ 3 | _ _ 1 /s
7 _ _ | _ 2 _ | _ _ 6 /s
------+-------+------ /s
_ 6 _ | _ _ _ | 2 8 _ /s
_ _ _ | 4 1 9 | _ _ 5 /s
_ _ _ | _ 8 _ | _ 7 9 /s

Before insert confirm if this is a valid sudoku board.

Second step is to run the [main.py](main.py) and select the algorithm to solve the board. Chose one of four options, 1 resolve using BFS, 2 resolve using aStar, 3 resolve using both and 4 exit of program.

 ## Extra Options
 ### Test Solving Algorithms

For testing performance of both algorithms we use [py-sudoku project](https://pypi.org/project/py-sudoku/). We imported this project to our code to edit de print method with objective to facilitate the coversion of sudoku board to array.

For generate the tests boards and calculate yours outpus run tests.py
