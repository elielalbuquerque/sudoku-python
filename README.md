# sudoku-ia-unisinos
This working is part of Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems discipline in Unisinos's Computer Science postgraduate program. Here you can find some solvers aproches like a implementation of simple [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) search algorithm, has too a implementation with [Depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) algorithm and one aproach based in backtracking algorithm with the  Minimum Remaining Value (MRV) heuristic. A simple python console application that reads an input sudoku from [_input.txt_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zanattabruno/sudoku-ia-unisinos/master/input.txt?token=AHTNX33H5GWYRPVB3WNKDUS7BPLS4) and solves it using above algorithms.
