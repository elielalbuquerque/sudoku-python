This working is part of discipline A rtificial Inteligence ans Inteligent Systems. Here you can find some solvers aproches like a implementation of simple [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) search algorithm, has too a implementation with [Depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) and one aproach based in backtracking with the heuristic Minimum Remaining Value (MRV). A simple python console application that reads an input sudoku from _input.txt_ and solves it using above algorithms.
